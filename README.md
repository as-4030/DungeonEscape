My first game made with LibGDX.

I'm planning to make some sort of level scheme, where this dog has to go through 5 levels/floors of a dungeon to win the game. How feasible is this? Pretty feasible.
I made my initial commit kinda late into the game process, as I just finished learning Git at an intermediate level.

Let's go!
